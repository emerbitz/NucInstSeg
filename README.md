# Nuclei instance segmentation - NucInstSeg
Nuclei instance segmentation serves as a preliminary step for cell tracking, phenotypic classification, and feature extraction in more general terms. Thus, the performance of these downstream tasks relies on the quality of the nuclei instance segmentation. However, nuclei instance segmentation is challenging due to variations in the size, shape and staining of nuclei and overlapping or aggregated nuclei. This project aims to develop a U-Net derived network for nuclei instance segmentation from 2D images.
